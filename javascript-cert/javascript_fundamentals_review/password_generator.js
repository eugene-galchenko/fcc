// Build a Password Generator App
// In this lab, you'll practice using functions by building a random password generator.

// Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

// User Stories:

// You should create a function called generatePassword that takes a parameter, indicating the length of generated password. You can name the parameter whatever you like.
// Your function should return a string which represents a randomly generated password. You should use the following string and different Math methods to help you return a new string with random characters in it: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*().
// You should define a variable called password and assign it the result of calling the generatePassword function with a numeric argument that represents the desired password length.
// You should have a console.log that logs a single string made by concatenating the message Generated password: and the password variable separated by a space.
// Tests:
// Waiting:1. You should have a generatePassword function with a parameter. You can name the parameter whatever you like.
// Waiting:2. Your generatePassword function should return a string.
// Waiting:3. Your generatePassword function should return a new string that is the correct length.
// Waiting:4. Your function should return a randomly generated password with valid characters.
// Waiting:5. Your function should return a randomly generated password which contains more than one unique character.
// Waiting:6. Your function should return a new random string each time it is called.
// Waiting:7. You should have a password variable.
// Waiting:8. Your password variable should be a string.
// Waiting:9. You should call the generatePassword function with a numeric argument and store the returned password in the password variable.
// Waiting:10. You should log a single string combining Generated password: and the password separated by a single space using + or a template literal.

function generatePassword(passwordsLength){
  let characters = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*()';
  let password = [];
  for( let i = 0; i < passwordsLength; i ++){
    password.push(characters[Math.floor(Math.random() * characters.length)]);
  }
  return password.join("");
}

const password = generatePassword(10);
console.log("Generated password: " + password);

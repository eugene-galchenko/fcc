// Build a Pyramid Generator
// Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

// User Stories:

// You should have a function named pyramid that takes three arguments.
// The first argument should be a string representing the pattern character to repeat in your pyramid.
// The second argument should be an integer representing the number of rows in the pyramid.
// The third argument should be a Boolean value.
// The pyramid function should return a string in which the pattern character is repeated and arranged to form a pyramid having the vertex facing upwards when the third argument is false.
// When the third argument is true the pyramid should have the vertex facing downwards.
// The vertex row should have a single pattern character, and each other row should have two pattern characters more than the previous one.
// Each row should start with a number of spaces sufficient to put the center character of each row in the same column and there should not be any spaces at the end of each row.
// The pyramid should start and end with a newline character.
// For example, calling pyramid("o", 4, false) should give this output:


//    o
//   ooo
//  ooooo
// ooooooo

// Tests:
// Waiting:1. You should have a function named pyramid.
// Waiting:2. Your pyramid function should have three parameters.
// Waiting:3. pyramid("o", 4, false) should return "\n   o\n  ooo\n ooooo\nooooooo\n".
// Waiting:4. pyramid("p", 5, true) should return "\nppppppppp\n ppppppp\n  ppppp\n   ppp\n    p\n".

      chars = 1 + i * 2;
